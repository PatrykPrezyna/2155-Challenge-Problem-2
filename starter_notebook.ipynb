    "In this challenge problem, you've been hired as an urban planner for an urban development project in a budding city. The city is rapidly expanding and has a large area that they are looking to zone. The mayor has asked you to consult with several of their advisors to figure out an optimal zoning strategy. These advisors are an interesting bunch. They mean well, but they are somewhat biased towards their own areas of expertise. Pleasing all of them will be tricky!"
